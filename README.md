## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nethru2002/seat-reservation-system.git
cd seat-reservation-system
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file (copy from .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, open the newly created `.env` file and fill in your PostgreSQL credentials and an [Ethereal](https://ethereal.email/) account for testing emails.

### 3. Database Setup
1.  Open your PostgreSQL client (e.g., `psql` or pgAdmin).
2.  Create a new database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE seat_reservation_db;
    ```
3.  Connect to the new database and run the SQL script located at `/backend/database.sql` to create all the necessary tables and types.
    *(Note: You will need to create this `database.sql` file by copying the SQL from our previous steps)*

### 4. Running the Application
1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # From the /backend directory
    node server.js
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend:**
    -   Navigate to the `/frontend` directory in your file explorer.
    -   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
